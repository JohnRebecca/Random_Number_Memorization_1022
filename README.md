The game starts by welcoming the user with the name of the game and team name below it. Then the user will be prompted to click a button to start playing the game. After that, the user will be taken to another screen where they will choose the difficulty. Next, the user will keep getting numbers to memorize until they make a mistake or guess incorrectly. Finally, when the user is finished playing the game there will be a button prompting the user to see their high score. 

1. User is greeted by a “Welcome” and prompted to click 1 of 2 buttons
2. Button 1: Below the title of the game ; “START”
3. Button 2: Below the Play button; “HighScores” where the user will be able to see their highest 3-5 scores and if they have not played yet, a message will be written as “play game to view your high score”
4. Clicking the button will cause it to change color slightly into a lighter tone (clicking animation if possible)
5. Once the user presses the “START” button they will be moved to a screen where a message stating “Memorize the Number(s)” will appear alongside a random number (between 0-9) 
6. The user will then have to press a button called “NEXT” and this will hide the displayed number and prompt the user to enter the number that was displayed earlier into a textbox
7. After the number is entered and the user presses the “CONFIRM” button the program will check and see if the number entered matches the number displayed
